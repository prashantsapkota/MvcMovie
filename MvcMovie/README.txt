Added a controller to an MVC app
Appended /Helloworld to the path in the address bar .The index method returned a string

We have a good start to the movie app  
but Release date should be two words
1310  The DataType attribute specifies the type of the data (Date)
1315 The Edit, Details, and Delete links are generated by the Core MVC Anchor Tag Helper in the Views/WebApplication1s/Index.cshtml file.
Opened the WebApplication1s controller and examine the two Edit action methods.
1320 included properties in the [Bind] attribute that you want to change.

1325The HttpPost attribute specifies that this Edit method can be invoked only for POST requests.
When the scaffolding system created the Edit view, it examined the WebApplication1 class and created code to render <label> and <input> elements for each property of the class\
1326 The scaffolded code uses several Tag Helper methods to streamline the HTML markup. 
The Label Tag Helper displays the name of the field
I found it easy doing upto this process
1327 I then Run the application and navigate to the /WebApplication1s URL. 
All the methods that create, edit, delete, or otherwise modify data do so in the [HttpPost] overload of the method.

1340 I pushed in github and checked in there but i got some issues in there
